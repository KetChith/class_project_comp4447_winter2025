# Assessing the Impact of Drought on Corn and Soybean Productivity

## Instructions  
1. Run **`project.ipynb`** to execute the analysis.  
2. Ensure that **no unrelated CSV files** are saved in the directory, as the code will **override existing files**, potentially leading to inaccurate results.  
3. Install all required packages as listed in the **`requirements.txt`** file before running the project.

## Overview
This project investigates the relationship between drought severity (measured using the Drought Severity and Coverage Index, DSCI) and crop yields and prices for corn and soybeans in five U.S. states. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and regression modeling to determine if drought significantly affects agricultural markets.

## Project Goals
* Analyze trends in crop acreage, yield, and price over time.
Assess the impact of drought on crop prices and yields using T-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and regression analysis.
Investigate adjusted yield and price metrics by normalizing values based on drought severity.
Identify key factors influencing price and yield variations.
Propose improvements for further research and analysis.
