## Instructions  
1. Run **`project.ipynb`** to execute the analysis.  
2. Ensure that **no unrelated CSV files** are saved in the directory, as the code will **override existing files**, potentially leading to inaccurate results.  
3. Install all required packages as listed in the **`requirements.txt`** file before running the project.
